= Fitbit API

Following are the examples on how to use Fitbit API:

== Register user on Fitbit

This endpoint will actually be called from official FItbit API and we will get the code which can be used
to obtain token for given user in our database.

NOTE: Here, user is automatically registered by service in application, so we don't see the actual token response.
