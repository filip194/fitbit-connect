[[overview]]
== Introduction

Fitbit Connect DEMO enables you to register, search, update and delete users, and it enables you to register your user on Fitbit
and collect data from Fitbit that user produces.
Tracking user activities is the only Fitbit feature of this app for now.

NOTE: This application is made with a learning purpose in mind while using Spring Boot with maven, documenting the APIs,
searching, paging and sorting the result sets, security and a lot more.
